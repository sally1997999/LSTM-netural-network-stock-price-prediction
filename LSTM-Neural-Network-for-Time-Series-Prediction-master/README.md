# LSTM Neural Network for Time Series Prediction

The orginal code can be found via the producer who wrote " LSTM built using the Keras Python package to predict time series steps and sequences. Includes sine wave and stock market data. [Full article write-up for this code](https://www.altumintelligence.com/articles/a/Time-Series-Prediction-Using-LSTM-Deep-Neural-Networks) [Video on the workings and usage of LSTMs and run-through of this code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2np77NOdnwk) "

I have made some changes which enables us to have continuous data point. The file config is used to change file and inputs.
